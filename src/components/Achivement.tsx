            <strong>Mehrotra Buildcon Pvt. Ltd.</strong> was initially incorporated as a partnership firm in the year 1979 and was
            later converted into a Private Limited Company in the year 2000. MBPL carved out its name in the civil
            construction arena after diversification and gradually made its presence felt in major sectors of the
            construction business by successfully executing civil works on both manpower deployment and unit rate
            basis.
          </p>

          <p>
            The company pioneered the construction of Railways and Highways, Major and Minor Bridges, ROBs, Railway
            Sidings, Industrial Structures, Institutional and Commercial Buildings, and many more. It also diversified into
            mining and material handling activities and now has a long experience of more than two decades in these
            sectors.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the past three decades, the construction division has successfully executed a wide variety of prestigious
            projects including major river and minor bridges, ROBs and RUBs (with pile and well foundations using PSC or
            steel girders), along with earthwork in embankments. The company has also undertaken complete railway siding
            projects including OHE, S&T, and track laying works. Additionally, MBPL has been involved in mining activities
            such as raising limestone and removal of overburden for cement plants, as well as handling raw and finished
            materials in cement plants.
          </p>

          <p>
            The company has built grid switchyards, industrial structures, and various structures for cement and power
            sectors including packing plants and silos. MBPL takes immense pride in its record of timely completion of every
            project undertaken without compromising on quality, safety, or environmental standards.
          </p>

          <p>
            The company earlier acquired certification for <strong>ISO 9001:2008</strong> and now holds <strong>ISO 9001:2015</strong>,
            reflecting its commitment to quality, safety, and environmental responsibility â€” which has earned the
            confidence of its clients. MBPL has the distinct privilege of successfully executing over <strong>300 projects</strong>,
            supported by a strong team of technical and commercial personnel, excluding the labour and muster staff
            employed directly at project sites as per project requirements.
          </p>

          <p>
            The company has two offices located in <strong>Satna</strong> and a regional office in <strong>NCR</strong>. The promoters of the
            company also serve on the management boards of several Engineering and Management Institutes in Satna,
            Allahabad, and Indore. The management of these institutes is also deeply involved in welfare and social
            activities.
          </p>

          <p>
            The company has also ventured into the <strong>Real Estate</strong> business under the name and style of <em>&quot;Emerald Greens&quot;</em>.
            Furthermore, its sister concern, <strong>M/s N.K. Industries</strong>, is actively engaged in the logistics sector, handling
            transportation of fly ash, cement, and other bulk materials.
